The [Seeed Studio Wio-E5 module](https://www.seeedstudio.com/LoRa-LoRaWAN-Modules-c-1950.html) is embedded with the ST system-level package chip STM32WLE5JC, ARM Cortex M4 ultra-low power MCU, and Long Range SX126X. It supports EU868, US915 and more, making it suitable for wireless sensor networks and other IoT devices that require battery power, low power consumption and long range.

We will be using the Wio-E5 mini for this guide, but the process should be the same for the other boards.

## AT Commands

First connect the Wio-E5 mini to your computer via a Type-C cable.

Then open a serial tool (For example the [Arduino IDE's](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) Serial Monitor), select the correct COM port and set the baudrate to `9600`.

In the serial monitor's message field, type `AT` and press enter. You should see a response back.

Now move to {{% tts %}} Console, create an application and click **Register end device**. Check [Adding Devices](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/devices/adding-devices/) for more info.

## Onboarding to {{% tts %}}

The device can be onboarded using the **Device Repository** or **manually**.

The [LoRaWANÂ® Device repository](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/lorawan-devices) comprises over 800 end-device profiles, including the Wio-E5 mini, which enables quick and easy registration with {{% tts %}}.

To onboard with the **Device Repository**, in the **End device type** section, under **Input method**, select the **Select the end device in the LoRaWAN Device Repository** option. The [Onboarding devices without QR codes]({{< ref "/devices/adding-devices/#onboarding-devices-without-qr-codes" >}}) section of the [Adding Devices]({{< ref "/devices/adding-devices/" >}}) guide explains this procedure in detail. Following details are Wio-E5 mini-specific:

- **End device brand:** Seeed Technology Co., Ltd
- **Model:** Wio-E5 mini (STM32WLE5JC) Dev Board
- **Hardware Ver.:** `1.0`
- **Firmware Ver.:** `1.0`

{{< figure src="repository-onboard.png" alt="Settings for registration through device repository" >}}

If you prefer onboarding **manually**, in the **End device type** section, under **Input Method**, select the **Enter end device specifics manually** option. The [Manually adding devices]({{< ref "/devices/adding-devices/manual/" >}}) and [Over the Air Activation (OTAA)]({{< ref "/devices/adding-devices/manual/otaa/" >}}) guides explain this procedure in detail. Following details are specific to the Wio-E5 mini:

- **LoRaWAN version:** `LoRaWAN Specification 1.0.3`
- **Regional parameters version:** `RP001 Regional Parameters 1.0.3 revision A`

Now when you scroll down, you will see the **Provisioning Information**. We will need to get this information from the device. To do so go back to your serial monitor and send the following AT commands on the serial monitor:

- `AT+ID=DevEui` to get your Device EUI
- `AT+ID=AppEui` to get your App EUI

The output will be as follows:

```
Tx: AT+ID=DevEui
Rx: +ID: DevEui, 2C:F7:F1:20:24:90:03:63
Tx: AT+ID=AppEui
Rx: +ID: AppEui, 80:00:00:00:00:00:00:07
```

Now go back to the stack and enter the details for your device.

Finally we need to set the `AppKey`. To do this, click **Generate** next to the Appkey in {{% tts %}} and copy it. Then run the following AT command:

- `AT+KEY=APPKEY,"generated-appkey"` to set the App Key

The output will be as follows:

```
Tx: AT+KEY=APPKEY,"2B7E151628AED2A6ABF7158809CF4F3C"
Rx: +KEY: APPKEY 2B7E151628AED2A6ABF7158809CF4F3C
```

{{< figure src="prov-info.png" alt="Provisioning Information" width="70%" >}}

After configuring your device, click the **Register end device** button.

Now your device is registered, but we still need to connect it to {{% tts %}}. To do so type the following AT commmands:

```
// If you are using US915
AT+DR=US915
AT+CH=NUM,8-15

// If you are using EU868
AT+DR=EU868
AT+CH=NUM,0-2

AT+MODE=LWOTAA
AT+JOIN
```

The output on serial monitor will be as follows:

```
Tx: AT+DR=US915
Rx: +DR: US915
Tx: AT+CH=NUM,8-15
Rx: +CH: NUM, 8-15

Tx: AT+MODE=LWOTAA
Rx: +MODE: LWOTAA

Tx: AT+JOIN
Rx: +JOIN: Start
+JOIN: NORMAL
+JOIN: Network joined
+JOIN: NetID 000013 DevAddr 26:01:5F:66
+JOIN: Done
```

If you see `+JOIN: Network joined` on your serial console, that means your device has successfully connected to {{% tts %}}!
